INGREDIENTS
1/2 pound flank steak, sliced about 1/8 inch thick
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon sugar
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon Shaoxing wine
1/2 teaspoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon plus 3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
1/2 teaspoon cornstarch
1 ginger piece, sliced quarter inch thick
1/2 pound mix variety of mushrooms, sliced about a quarter inch or more thick
2 teaspoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon butter
2 medium cloves garlic, finely minced (about 1 teaspoon)
Steamed white rice, for serving

DIRECTIONS
1.
Place the beef in a large bowl. Add the salt, sugar, ground black pepper, Shaoxing wine, soy sauce, 1 teaspoon oil, and cornstarch. Mix well and set aside for 30 minutes.
2.
When ready to cook, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a wok over high heat until smoking. Add the ginger. Cook for 30 seconds and then remove and discard the ginger.

3.
If the wok is no longer smoking, reheat until it is, then add the beef. Spread the beef out with the spatula, cook without moving until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Continue to cook while stirring regularly until half cooked, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.

4.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in wok over high heat until smoking. Add the mushrooms. Stir and cook the mushrooms until they start releasing their water. Continue cooking, stirring frequently, until the water evaporates. Depending on the type of mushrooms you use, this can take 5 minutes or more.
5.
Once the water evaporates, add 2 teaspoons of soy sauce. Stir and add in the butter and garlic. Toss the butter with the mushrooms until fragrant, about 1 minute, then return the beef to the wok. Cook, stirring, until beef is cooked through, about 1 minute longer. Transfer to a serving platter immediately and serve with white rice.
